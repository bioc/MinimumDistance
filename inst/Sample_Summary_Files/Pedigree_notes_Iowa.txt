Samples arrived on site 030309.  Manifest had sample 24044_04, which was not in the pedigree file.  Sample was in pretesting report but group said to use original aliquot.  Jackie said to NOT go ahead with the replacement aliquot so it was deleted from manifest.  Changed the MTA site to COREFAF as samples came from Laura's lab. UPloaded to RIS as 375_Beaty_Iowa_030509.csv
