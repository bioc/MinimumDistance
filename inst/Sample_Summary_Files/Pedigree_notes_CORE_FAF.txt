Received Phase I check approval from Jenna at GENEVA 112008; discussion between Jenna and Jackie made me realize some DNA 2's had been coded in the pedfile as DNA 1's, asked Jackie if these were indeed duplicates and if she'd like me to update the pedfile, she stated yes so I changed to DNA 2 the following ID's:
24086_01

24086_04

24087_01

24087_04

24088_01

24088_04

Uploaded to cidrweb as 375_Beaty_Core-FAF_112408.csv, also put in shipment_site code for CORE instead of SINGAPORE since samples will be coming to us from CORE.
