Received pedfile for back up samples (CIDR_backups_pedigree.xls); duplicates not included.  Spoke with CDB and conclusion was to ask Jackie to add dup in case these samples ended up being used so as not to have to ask for dups later in the project.  Also reported errors encountered with IRB codes when attempting to merge all 3 files.
